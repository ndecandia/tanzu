The first step, of example, is to go ahead and create a text file.
Call it pod.yaml and add the following text, just as we specified it earlier:

File: pod.yaml

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: website
  labels:
    app: application01
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Save the file, and tell Kubernetes to create its contents using Imperative approach:

```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```

> ```bash
> pod/website created
> ```

As you can see, K8s references the name we gave the Pod. You can see that if you ask for a list of the pods:

```bash
kubectl get po
```

> ```bash
> NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
> website   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          7s
> ```

If you check early enough, you can see that the pod is still being created. After a few seconds, you should see the containers running:

```bash
kubectl get po
```

> ```bash
> NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
> website   1/1     Running   0          43s
> ```

Try to describe the schedule processes and information of the Pod:

```bash
kubectl describe pod/website
```

> ```bash
> Name:         website
> Namespace:    default
> Priority:     0

You can edit the YAML of the pod directly using *kubectl edit*
Change the image from nginx to httpd

```bash
kubectl edit pod/website
```

From:

```yml
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
```

To:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - image: httpd
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
```

When you save the file (if you are using vim, you can do :wq)
You will obtain the following result:

> ```bash
> pod/website edited
> ```

Try to describe your POD filtering only Image.

```bash
kubectl describe pod/website | grep Image:
```

> ```bash
>     Image:          httpd
> ```

As you can see, the image are changed by nginx to httpd
The nginx container had been killed and created a new one with httpd.
