# CronJob


Create the new file with the command:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cronjob-hello
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: cron-hello
            image: r.deso.tech/library/alpine
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo Hello, Desotech Student!
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

For cronjob schedulation you can follow this link: https://crontab.guru/

Save and close the file, apply it.

```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob-hello.yaml
```

> ```
> cronjob.batch/cronjob-hello created
> ```

You can ensure the cronjob task is running with the command:

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs
```

> ```
> NAME            SCHEDULE       SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
> cronjob-hello   */10 * * * *   False     0        <none>          28s
> ```

How to watch for the cronjob?
Let's say you've deployed a container with an associated cronjob and you want to watch for it.
To do that, you'd issue the command:

```bash
kubectl get jobs --watch
```

The output of that command will include a running list of every deployed job

> ```
> NAME                       COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
> cronjob-hello-1607447700   0/1                      0s
> cronjob-hello-1607447700   0/1           0s         0s
> cronjob-hello-1607447700   1/1           4s         4s
> cronjob-hello-1607447760   0/1                      0s
> cronjob-hello-1607447760   0/1           0s         0s
> cronjob-hello-1607447760   0/1           0s         1s
> cronjob-hello-1607447760   1/1           3s         4s
> ```

To end that watch, use the ++ctrl++ + ++c++ combination.
A new job will be started every minute.

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

> ```
> NAME                             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
> cronjob-hello-1607447700-5mqsq   0/1     Completed   0          2m28s
> cronjob-hello-1607447760-cnbjs   0/1     Completed   0          98s
> ```

Delete cronjob:

```bash
kubectl delete cronjob cronjob-hello
```

> ```
> cronjob.batch "cronjob-hello" deleted
> ```

By deleting the cronjob you will also delete the completed pods.

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

> ```
> No resources found in namespace01 namespace.
> ```
